## Please review the following carefully:

See the blog article [Parking Assistant with MQTT](https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2021/07/parking-assistant-with-mqtt-and-vehicle.html) for preparing the Raspberry Pi and installing other required libraries.

Place the parking_tf.py file in its own directory under /home/pi on the Raspberry Pi.  Edit the file to provide your MQTT broker information (or remark out/remove this section if not using MQTT).  See the documentation within the Python file.

Review and edit the section on setting the proper nominal distance for your parked vehicle.
