This project is heavily based on the original Instructables project by medinc [Pi Based Parking Assist System](https://www.instructables.com/Pi-Based-Parking-Assist-System/) but makes a number of changes:
* Removes secondary side sensor
* Uses USB-TTL adpator for LIDAR sensor (instead of I2C via GPIO)
* Adds MQTT
* Other minor changes

Please see the my blog [Parking Assistant with MQTT and Vehicle Presence Sensors](https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2021/07/parking-assistant-with-mqtt-and-vehicle.html) for parts list, wiring and assembly for this version.

If you are looking for the ESP8266/WS2812b version, you can find that in [this repository](https://github.com/Resinchem/ESP-Parking-Assistant).
